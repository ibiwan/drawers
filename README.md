# drawers

## collaborative whiteboard sketching system

```
git clone https://github.com/ibiwan/drawers.git
cd drawers
npm install
nodemon app.js 
```

Access ``` http://localhost:3000 ``` from a browser.  Or two browsers.

Draw things on the whiteboard.  With a mouse or something.

Any new clients connecting should receive all existing drawings.

For now, reset the server to clear drawing.  Clients will need to be reloaded.
